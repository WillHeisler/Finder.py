My first attempt of writing a Python program for a functional purpose.

Accepts CLI arguments or run it and it will ask questions.
Purpose is to find files on a system. ie. If you know the name and directory or a file
or if you just downloaded a file, don't remember what the name was or where it was saved
then you can search based on a known unique string (string or input txt file) within the file. 

Currently only searches for .txt and .docx files. Future support will dump the output into
a .txt files for you to sift through and to parse .xlsx and .cxv files.

Currently the output function only works on Windows, I have to work out any issues on Linux.
